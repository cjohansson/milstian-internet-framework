# Issues

Here I have collected what is left to-do.

## TCP-HTTP

* Support content-encodings: gzip, compress, deflate, identity, br
* Make it easy to use third-party libraries like HTTP over TLS for HTTPS
* Support TCP requests that exceeds limit with a error responder
* Make integration-tests to verifies it's functionality
* Should log response status code and request message line

## General

* Create a TOML configuration parser
* Create a command-line parser
* Create a session handling framework
* Create a template engine framework
* Create a cache engine framework

## Guidelines

* Refactor parts as stand-alone crates when possible
* Publish stand-alone crates on crates.io
